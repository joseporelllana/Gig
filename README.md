## Project Description

Version	Changes	Date
v1.0	Initial project outline.	
v1.1	Wireframes change & UI difference.

GigBook is an app dedicated to tracking all the concerts and live music users attend. Its purpose is to serve as a journal to document all the live music experiences users have. Users will be able to create their own GigBook with a unique name and customize it through color, themes, and layout. A GigBook will contain different entries for every concert. Each entry will include information such as:

- Tour Name
- Artist
- Venue

- Time
- Setlist
- Length

Additionally, users can rate each concert and add pictures and videos to concert entries.

The primary goal is to provide users with a unique, personalized archive of their concert experiences. Users will be able to connect with others who have similar tastes and understand each other based on the music they consume.

## Problem Addressing

Current concert goers have no way of documenting their concert experience and making that record completely theirs. The application will create a space where all that information is stored, organized, and protected. GigBook provides them with a platform to document the live music they attend and make it completely theirs.  

## Platform

The app will be built for Android Mobile devices. Kotlin/Java will be the programming language to build the application. The popularity of Android will result in a bigger customer base. 

## Front/Back-End Support

- **Backend**: Firebase will be used as the database service provider. It will manage user accounts, concert entries, and other  data.
- **Storage**: Google Cloud will be utilized for storing images and videos securely.

## Functionality

- Users will create their own unique GigBook with a custom name.
- Each GigBook will have a tagline and be searchable by its name.
- Users can track both past and future concerts.
- Concert entries can be shared via social media.
- Collaborative entries can be created with other users to document experiences together.
